The Great Magician and owner of a fantastical [[Carnival ]] where he delights and entertains with skillful magic 

He has strong men and con artists and dancers and many more under his employ to put on a performance that will be remembered 

He is strangely tall with lavender eyes that match his purple and gold suit. He is eye catching in nearly every way. 


Secretly he is the Simulacrum for [[Vaelith - illusion, deception, trickery]] and is how the god directly influences the mortal world.
