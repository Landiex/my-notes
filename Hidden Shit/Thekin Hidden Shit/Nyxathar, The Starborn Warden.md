# Backstory:
Born from the dying breath of a collapsing star, Nyxathar is no ordinary dragon. He emerged in the heart of the celestial void, his scales woven from the very fabric of the cosmos. Legends say he was created by the gods themselves to guard the balance between order and chaos, ensuring that neither force tips the cosmic scale too far.

For eons, Nyxathar drifted through the [[Astral Plane]], absorbing the wisdom of the universe and deciphering the hidden truths of existence. His wings, charged with the energies of supernovae, allowed him to traverse realms unseen by mortals. His eyes, burning with the light of a thousand suns, could see the fate of stars before they were even born.

# Personality & Traits:
Wise and Calculating: Having observed the cosmos for millennia, Nyxathar is deeply philosophical and cautious in action.
Stoic but Compassionate: He does not interfere with mortal affairs lightly, but he recognizes their importance in the grand scheme of things.
Unyielding Protector: If a force threatens the balance of the universe, Nyxathar will stop at nothing to see it neutralized.

# Abilities & Powers:

<u>Stellar Breath:</u>Instead of fire, Nyxathar breathes a beam of condensed starlight, capable of erasing creatures from existence.

<u>Astral Sight:</u> He can see across dimensions and peer into the destinies of those he encounters.

<u>Gravity Manipulation:</u> His mere presence bends space, allowing him to alter gravity in his surroundings.
<u>Divine Resistance:</u> As a being of celestial origin, Nyxathar is highly resistant to necrotic and arcane corruption.

# Adventure Hooks:
<u>Fallen from the Cosmos:</u> Nyxathar has been wounded in battle and crash-landed on the Material Plane. The party stumbles upon him, and their actions determine whether he becomes an ally or a terrifying force to reckon with.
