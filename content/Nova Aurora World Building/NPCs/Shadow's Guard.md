Trained soldiers that work for [[Michael Covington]] as an extension of his will. Likely trained from a young age. 

originally their purpose was secretly intended to be a force that can fight back against the Sentinels when the time is right, but over time and through Michael's twisted world view, they have ended up becoming more enforcement than protector.
