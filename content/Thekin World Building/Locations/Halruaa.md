 Halruaa, far to the south, on what amounts to a large island off the coast of the Mainland, is one of the furthest south settlements and cities on the continent.  It's hemmed in by mountains, and due to it's far southern climate, almost always covered in some level of frost and snow.  To combat the frozen terrain around them, Halruaa has developed high rise towers and floating platforms to keep away from the chill.  Technological and magical advancement was poured into keeping their growing cities aloft and developing efficient heat sources and greenhouses to provide stable food sources.  Nowadays, their city is known for their impressive skyships and magical feats defying gravity and the chill.
