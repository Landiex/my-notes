![[Vitreus Map.png]]


This is the metropolitan capital of Thekin. This city dwarfs most other settlements on the continent really only rivalled in size by Holt. 

Vitreus is the seat of power for the [[Magi]] who took over in brutal efficiency some 100 years ago. Their seat of power is houses in what is known as the [[Crystal Palace]]

Vitreus is home to several of your classic guilds such as a [[Fighter 's Guild]], [[Mage's College]], and [[Thieves Guild]]. 

There is also a small rival guild run by a young man named [[Thomas Lethe]] and his gaggle of orphaned children 

[[The Gilded Quarter]] makes up the Rich folk. Wealthy merchants, politicians, and other such powerful people make their home there. 

[[Highstreet]] is near the [[Crystal Palace]], and where many of the [[Magi]] make their homes 

South of that, on the other side of the palace is [[Sentinel's Roost]] where the bulk of the peace keeping forces maintain their arms and barracks. 

The south west corner of the city is made of the [[Emberstone Quarter]]. this is where the [[Bazaar]] is held, and it is filled with artisans and craftsmen, and also subsequently is where the [[Ulanwa-Varna Tavern]] is located. 

the south east quarter makes up "The Warrens" which is quite a bit poorer than the rest of the city, and houses some of the more unsavory types such as the [[Thieves Guild]].
