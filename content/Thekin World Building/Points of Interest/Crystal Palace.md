This is a massive crystalline structure made up of what appears to be pure emerald. It was erected seemingly overnight when the [[Magi]] took over what was then known as [[Cinderhold]] and made it into their capital city. 

It dominates the center of [[Vitreus]] and is the fortress from which the [[Magi]] operate and oversee their quiet domination over the Continent 

The [[Mage's College]] sits not far from this impressive structure
