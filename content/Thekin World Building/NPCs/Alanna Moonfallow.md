Married to [[Rhovanor Moonfallow]]

Exceedingly powerful wizard who maintains the physical structure of the backrooms of the [[Ulanwa-Varna Tavern]] through sheer force of will and magical energy. 

Approximately 350 years old she has lived through much of history that has already begun being forgotten. 

Lived on the [[White Cliffs]] just outside of [[Holt]] around the time the [[Magi]] attacked. 

She is a powerful destruction mage capable of calling storms but her true love and focus has been on unlocking the fabric of reality and the ability to create new space. 

Her Magnum Opus is the ever changing labyrinth of the back rooms in her Tavern. The rooms and functions are added to, moved around, and taken away as she seems fit so the structure never quite seems the same.
