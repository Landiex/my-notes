Friend of [[Alanna Moonfallow]], [[Rhovanor Moonfallow]], and [[Cylus Merrick]] he runs the bar portion of the [[Ulanwa-Varna Tavern]] and when needed he acts as a bouncer if the crowd gets too rowdy. 

He is a hulking man at 6'5" and almost 285 pounds of solid muscle honed through years of fighting. In full plate steel with a great sword at the ready he is one of the most formidable sights in all of Thekin. 

Despite his stature and gruffness he is a genuinely kind individual who is protective of those he cares about and will fight to the death to protect those who can't protect themselves. 

He hails from the far [[Northern Highlands]] where the landscape is harsh and cold. His people have a clan structure with separate family groups dotted throughout the frozen landscape. At times warring with one another, they don't occasion band together of the cause is great enough, and woe be unto whoever earns all of the clan's ire.
