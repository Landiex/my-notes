Friend of [[Alanna Moonfallow]], [[Rhovanor Moonfallow]], and [[Cayden Mortem]]

Former sailor....possibly pirate. 

He's a charismatic and witty man with an agile nature that he hides in apparent clumsiness. 

He wears a blindfold to hide his eyes which were damaged in some magical accident, but that doesn't mean he can't see. In fact he might see things more clearly than most.
