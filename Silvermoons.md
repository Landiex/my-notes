Secret organization that is fighting a guerrilla war against the [[Magi]]

Run primarily by [[Alanna Moonfallow]], [[Rhovanor Moonfallow]], and [[Cayden Mortem]]. [[Cylus Merrick]] is also an integral member of the small group. 

At the beginning of the story this group is quite small comprising roughly 50 members made up of random citizens throughout [[Vitreus]]

Their symbol is a stylized wolfs head howling over top of a full moon, and their weapons are made of a signature [[Anodized Steel]]. New members are also often granted a thin chainmail undershirt made of Mithril or sometimes even a full set of armor.
